# Restaurant-Menu-App

A Python driven Flask built restaurant menu web application.

### Requirements

To run this locally:

* Make sure you have an environment to Python 3.6.2
* You also need [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* And [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)


###Styling Concerns
Significant effort will be made at some point in time to add either Bootstrap or React as a front end.
